\chapter{Evaluation}

\section{Introduction}

Testing so far has comprised of using small contrived programs to test that statements work individually, and that a few statements work together as they should. However, to test that the designed coverage tools work in the real world, a real piece of software that is written in EOL will be studied. Conveniently Epsilon includes EuGENia which is written in EOL, and also has a test suite, making it the ideal candidate for a case study.
