\chapter{Branch Coverage}

\section{Introduction}
This chapter details my effort to implement branch coverage. The structure of the chapter is largely the same as the previous chapter. However, there is a lot more detail provided on the algorithm as it is thought to be the only detailed description on the process of converting an Abstract Syntax Tree into a Control Flow Graph.
