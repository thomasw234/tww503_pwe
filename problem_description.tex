\chapter{Analysis}

% General plan:

% 1. Explain that EuGENia has a few test cases already, take a quick look at them
% 2. Discus that these test cases have not been analysed in any way
% 3. Explain that the first step will be to investigate the line coverage of the EuGENia tests

To begin this project I must first investigate how thoroughly tested EuGENia is. Methods for doing this were investigated in the previous section.
