\chapter{Requirements Analysis}

\section{Introduction}

In this chapter I will perform some analysis on the requirements of this project. I will begin by identifying the stakeholders in this project, and explaining their role and general aims. From this, I will then move on to detail some derived functional requirements, followed by some derived non-functional requirements.

\section{Stakeholders}
A stakeholder in the most general sense is defined by \citet{stakeholderDef} as:

\begin{quote}
	A person, group or organization that has interest or concern in an organization
\end{quote}

More specifically in this project a stakeholder is someone or some group of people who have an interest in, or may benefit from, the contributions that my project makes to the field of model driven engineering or software testing.

I have identified the following stakeholders then from the above definition:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Enterprise Systems Group at The University of York
\item Developers who use EOL
\item Users of EuGENia
\item Project Supervisor
\item Student
\end{enumerate}

The Enterprise Systems Group is a group of academics and research students at The University of York. As outlined on their website \cite{ESG}, the group's primary objectives are to research and teach the fundamental objectives of enterprise systems. One of their main research areas is Model-Driven Development, which is how Epsilon came to be. Any contributions that my project make will be based around Epsilon, and should it be of a high enough standard then the outcome of my project may be incorporated into the Epsilon plugin.

The developers who use EOL is a potentially large group of people. As EuGENia is a transformation that is written in EOL, and EOL is not a language that is as widely used as say Java, the approach taken to testing will be thoroughly detailed so that another developer using EOL can use this thesis as a reference.

The users of EuGENia have an obvious interest in the outcome of my project. Should I find any bugs in EuGENia then I will either attempt to fix them, or at least alert the relevant people (such as a developer in the Enterprise Systems Group). This will improve the experience of EuGENia for users.

My project supervisor is a stakeholder in the project in a different way than the previously listed groups. He is currently and will continue to be involved in the project until the end. He sets deadlines, makes recommendations and suggests areas to research. His contribution steers the direction of the project throughout, and without him the project would be completely different (and to a much lower standard).

The student (myself) has a stake in the project. He is the primary researcher, developer and author of documentation. However his stake ends when the project is complete, as it is assumed that he will have no long-term benefit from the outcome of the project. For this reason, no requirements should be derived from the view of the student.

This is of course not a final list of requirements. Each is subject to change throughout the project should it be necessary. However, a reasonable attempt will be made to keep to these requirements, and any changes will be justified fully.
